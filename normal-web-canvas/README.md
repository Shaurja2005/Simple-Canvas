# Normal Web Canvas

This project is a simple web-based drawing canvas built built by me from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to draw freely on the canvas, with a unique feature: the mouse wheel changes the width of the lines being drawn in real time.

## Features
- Draw on the canvas using your mouse
- The clear all button cleans the drawing
- Adjust the width of the lines dynamically with the mouse wheel(width: 1-10)
- Clean and minimal UI
- No external libraries or frameworks

## How to Use
1. Click and drag your mouse on the canvas to draw.
2. Use the mouse wheel to increase or decrease the width of the lines as you draw.

## File Structure
- `index.html` — Main HTML file containing the canvas element
- `main.js` — JavaScript logic for drawing and handling mouse wheel events
- `styles.css` — Basic styling for the canvas and page

## Getting Started
No installation is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
